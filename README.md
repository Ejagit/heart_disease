# Heart Disease Prediction Project
## Introduction
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using a dataset containing various medical attributes. Accurate prediction of heart disease can help in early diagnosis and treatment, potentially saving lives. The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle.

## Goal
The primary goal of this project are to getting insights from the dataset, and to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a patient has heart disease based on their medical attributes. Additionally, the project includes the deployment of the model using Streamlit to create an interactive web application for user-friendly predictions.

## Step-by-Step Process

1. Data Cleansing

  - Loading the Data: Import the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

  - Handling Missing Values: Check for and address any missing or null values in the dataset.

  - Data Types: Ensure all data types are appropriate for analysis and modeling.

  - Outliers Detection and Treatment: Identify and handle outliers that may skew the model.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

  - Descriptive Statistics: Summarize the basic features of the dataset using descriptive statistics.

  - Data Visualization: Create visualizations (e.g., histograms, box plots, lineplot) to understand the relationships between variables, identify patterns, and getting insights.

  - Feature Engineering: Create new features or modify existing ones to improve model performance.
3. Modelling

  - Data Splitting: Divide the data into training and testing sets.

  - Model Selection: Using KNN, Random Forest, XGBOOST, Decision Tree.

  - Model Training: Train the models using the training dataset.

  - Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models using the testing dataset and select the best-performing model based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

  - Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the model parameters to enhance performance.

### Results
The results section will detail the performance of the selected model, including the evaluation metrics used. The final model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score will be reported, along with any insights gained from the analysis and modeling process, By following these steps, the heart disease prediction model can be effectively implemented in real-world healthcare environments, providing valuable insights and aiding in the early diagnosis and treatment of heart disease.
